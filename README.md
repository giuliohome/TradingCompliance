# TradingCompliance
This is a compliance app to monitor a trading and shipping system and to produce and manage alerts for anomalies.
It is integrated to Endur cMotion (or other similar apps in that market), which, of course is not sharable here.
It is a porting from C# aspx to F# WebSharper platform.


Acknowledgment
I've had a lot of fun while learning F# Functional Composition and I'm grateful for the fundamental help received from WebSharper gitter.

ToDo
You need to either mock-up or implement your own DB library to feed the data into the web app.
